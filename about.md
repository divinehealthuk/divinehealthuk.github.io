## About Kamila

From an early age, Kamila was fascinated by the connection between body, mind, and spirit — and how true health arises from restoring balance on all levels. Observing how many modern illnesses stem from emotional and energetic imbalance, she dedicated her life to understanding the deeper roots of wellbeing.

Her training spans **Traditional Chinese Medicine**, **Human Nutrition and Dietetics**, **Macrobiotics**, **Reiki**, **Qi Gong**, and **Yoga** — disciplines she artfully weaves together to help clients achieve harmony, vitality, and natural beauty.

Kamila’s passion lies in **natural rejuvenation** and **biohacking**, empowering people to look and feel their absolute best. Her approach combines ancient wisdom with modern insight, helping clients clear mental fog, release addictions, and awaken their innate radiance.

### Master face reading

Kamila is a graduate of the **Master Face Reading Program**, an advanced discipline within Chinese Medicine that reads the face as a living map of a person's health, emotions, and life patterns. Face reading interprets subtle lines, textures, and facial shapes to reveal underlying imbalances, emotional habits, and strengths. Used ethically and compassionately, this tool provides clear, personalized insight that complements clinical assessment — helping clients understand their past challenges, current health tendencies, and opportunities for future growth. In practice, face reading informs bespoke treatment plans that address both external beauty and internal wellbeing.

Combining precise clinical knowledge with intuitive perception, Kamila offers a premium, integrative experience — tailored programs that restore balance, refresh the body, and illuminate a more radiant expression of self.
